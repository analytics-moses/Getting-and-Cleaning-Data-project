* The Repo for the submission of the course project for the JHU Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data final project [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).



* _Overview_
In this project one demonostrates extracting and and cleaning of data for the sake of cretaing a Tidy Dataset for analysis in the future. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository

* The following is a summary description of the project instructions:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* _Instructions_
One should execute *run_analysis.R* in one's *R* Environment.

* _Cleaned Dataset_
The resulting clean Dataset *tidy_data.txt* is going to be located the *UCI HAR Dataset* subdirectory of one's *Working Directory*. This resulting Dataset contains a 'mean' for each variable of all 'subject'/'activity' records.
